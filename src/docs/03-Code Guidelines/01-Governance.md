YouSee DNA is created by us for us. Our Design system should reflect 80% of our needs, which means that if the design and code is not relevant for 80% of all squads it shouldnâ€™t be added to YouSee DNA, but stay and be governed within the squads.

In parallel to this site we have sat up a YouSee DNA Guild where everybody can join and suggest new elements to enter design system.

## Reviewers
For maintenance reasons we have set a team of reviewers looking at new suggested elements to see if guidelines and 80/20 rule.

The DNA reviewers are:
-	Michael Grandorf (Code)
-	Daniel dos Santos (Design)
-	Nicolai Fogh (UX)
