# Examples
## Bow
As the bow is only available in 100% of the viewport width, it is not possible to preview it "inline" — please see a [full screen preview](/components/preview/bow)

```html
{{render '@bow'}}
```

## Bow, midnight green
As the bow is only available in 100% of the viewport width, it is not possible to preview it "inline" — please see a [full screen preview](/components/preview/bow--midnight-green)

```html
{{render '@bow--midnight-green'}}
```

## HTML guidelines

## UX and Design guidelines

### When and how to use the bow
- In the TOP Tile / Hero Image (to add a clear separation of content)
- In the Footer (to state the end of the page)
- The Bow should always be as wide as the entire viewport and never be used inside smaller components

Don't over use it. No page should contain more than 3 bows.
