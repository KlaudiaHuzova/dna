A colour palette comprises primary and accent colours that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The colour palette starts with primary colours and secondary colours in a meaningful hierachy that conveys specific meanings.

> The following colour hierarchy was created to address some branding needs and also to keep it clear to users what is more important in the flow.

<div class="frctl-example">
    {{#each colors}}
        <dl class="colors">
            {{#each this}}
                <div class="colors__palette">
                    <dt class="colors__title">{{@key}}</dt>
                    {{#each this}}
                        <dd class="colors__item">
                            <div class="colors__color-swatch" style="background-color: {{@this}};">
                                <code class="colors__color-name" data-bg-color="{{@this}}">{{@this}}</code>
                            </div>
                            <code class="colors__variable-name">
                                <span class="colors__variable-text">$ys-color-{{@key}}</span>
                            </code>
                        </dd>
