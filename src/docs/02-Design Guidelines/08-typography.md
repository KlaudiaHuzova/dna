# Typography
Typographic hierarchy organizes type and establishes an order of importance within the content and this helps the user to easily find what they are looking for and navigate the content without hesitation.

> For accessibility reasons we should aim for a line-height adhering to the 8 point grid, which means rounding up numbers to meet the grid specs.

## YouSeeâ€™s Typeface
YouSee use the LTF Etica typeface (designed by [Type Together](https://www.type-together.com/)), which is used throughout the entire website.

The usage is limited to the following variations:
- LFT Etica Bold
- LFT Etica SemiBold
- LFT Etica Regular
- LFT Etica Light

## How to use:

### Color
As a general rule, all text on the website should be set in **ys-color-grey-28**, as defined in the [Colors section](colors) or **ys-color-white** when on dark backgrounds.

### Font sizes and weights
A set of typographic rules have been determined and implemented:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th scope="col">Mobile/Tablet<sup>1</sup></th>
    <th scope="col">Desktop<sup>2</sup></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Main Title<br />`.ys-main-title`</th>
    <td>Font size: 40px<br>Line height: 48px (1.2)<br>font weight: bold (700)</td>
    <td>Font size: 56px<br>Line-height: 72px (1.28)<br>font weight: bold (700)</td>
