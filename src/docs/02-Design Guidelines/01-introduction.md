## Why a Design System
It helps creating a consistent and distinctive brand experience

## What is a Design System?
A Design System is a living, breathing document that contains all our brand’s digital manifestations and a component library that cointains all our visual assets (components, iconography, color pale!es, grids, etc).
Its purpose consists of explaning to everyone that will work with the brand on a digital environment how to use the brand’s assets the best way possible taking into to consideration, for example, physical color VS display color or interactivity VS static images.

## Offline VS Online
There’s a big difference the way you show a brand offline and on online plataforms. A Design System should be designed with a 100% digital mindset, which means, taking into consideration, animations, microinteractions and most importantly, interactivity.
Those elements cannot be translated into and offline mean, therefore, a Digital CVI should live online, where all those manifestations can be demonstrated and exemplified.
