YouSee DNA is created by us for us. Our Design system should reflect 80% of our needs, which means that if the design and code is not relevant for 80% of all squads it shouldnâ€™t be added to YouSee DNA, but stay and be governed within the squads.

In parallel to this site we have sat up a YouSee DNA slack channel where everybody can suggest new elements and ask quiestions.
Please feel free to join #yousee-dna (it requires membership of the tdcgroup workspace).

## Reviewers
For maintenance reasons we have set a team of reviewers. Please get in touch with them or send them your pull request if you want to contribute.
