A colour palette comprises primary and accent colours that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The colour palette starts with primary colours and secondary colours in a meaningful hierachy that conveys specific meanings.

> The following colour hierarchy was created to address some branding needs and also to keep it clear to users what is more important in the flow.
