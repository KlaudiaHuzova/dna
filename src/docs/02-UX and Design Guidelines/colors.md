A colour palette comprises primary and accent colours that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The colour palette starts with primary colours and secondary colours in a meaningful hierachy that conveys specific meanings.

> The following colour hierarchy was created to address some branding needs and also to keep it clear to users what is more important in the flow. 

<div class="frctl-example">
{{#each colors}}
  <dl class="frctl-colors">
  {{#each this}}
    <div class="frctl-palette">
      <dt class="frctl-palette-title">{{@key}}</dt>
      {{#each this}}
        <dd class="frctl-color">
          <div class="frctl-color-swatch" style="background-color: {{@this}}">
             <code class="frctl-color-name" data-bg-color="{{@this}}">{{@this}}</code>
