# Card
In the physical world, objects can be stacked or affixed to one another, but cannot pass through each other. Objects also cast shadows and reflect light. Cards behave like objects so they should respect the same rules as objects.

Cards may contain a photo, text, and a link about a single subject. They may display content containing elements of varying size, such as photos with captions of variable length. A card collection is a layout of cards on the same plane.

## Shapes
Cards come in three different shapes:
- Big (default), which has a border radius of 16px
- Medium, which has a border radius of 8px
- Small, which has a border radius of 4px

## Colors
Cards come in two different colors:
- Light (default)
- Dark Grey

## Background Image
A Card can also contain a background image for visual purposes, but in this case no content is allowed, and it should only be used as decoration.

## Shadow
A Card can hide its shadow.

## UX and Design Guidelines
### When to use a card
- Collection or gallery comprises multiple data types, such as images, movies, text.
- When it requires interaction such as swipe, drag and drop, tap, etc

### Cards within cards
When using a card within a card, the shape should change as well, so that a **Big Card** contains a **Medium Card** which contains a **Small Card**
