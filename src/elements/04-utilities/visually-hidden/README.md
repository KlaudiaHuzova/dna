The `ys-u-visuallyhidden` class is used when the UI is showing elements, that _visually_ contain no text, ie. a button that only has an icon on it. In cases like these, we add an element with the `ys-u-visuallyhidden` class on it, to make sure that assistive technologies and search engines understand the purpose of the button.

**Please notice**: If you import css-files individually instead of using the bundle, be aware that all utility classes are part of the basic `base.css`-file, which is required, so there is no need to import them specifically.
