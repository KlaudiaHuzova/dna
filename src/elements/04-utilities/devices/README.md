Please be careful when using the device-specific utility classes:
- assistive technologies will not be able to access the hidden content
- search engines might not be able to index the hidden content

Also, there is a great chance that it's possible to achieve the desired effect using the grid-system.

**Please notice**: all utility classes are part of the basic `_base.scss`-file, which is required, so there is no need to import them specifically.
